Exercise 12 - Self feedback
------------------------
How you feel the content of the course (overall)?
How you feel the course web site and materials in Labranet GitLab?
Is the material suitable for a contact/virtual study? If not, what should be improved?
How about workload (low, ok, too much)?
How about evaluation (exercises and research assignment)?
Give a rating number from 1-5 (5 == excellent) to this course at overal
Something else you want to say about course...

I feel good about the content of the course. For me, the material in Labranet is quite good. The workload was not too much. It's ok. 
I would give myself as 4 because I never learnt these technologies. 
I have learnt a lot from this course but I cannot complete exercise 6 which I stuck with that problem.
(Will change later if I can figure it out)
